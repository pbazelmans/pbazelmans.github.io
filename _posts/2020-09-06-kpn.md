title:  "Using a FortiGate with KPN Internet and iTV"
tags: [kpn, fortigate]

For the last days, I was working to get my ISP connection @home (Which is from `KPN`) working with a FortiGate firewall. Well, it was a bit of a puzzle to get this working because information about this topic is very fragmented to find. So, I want to write about what I've done to get this working.

# What do I have? #

In my setup, I have the following components:
* Internet from KPN (dutch ISP) with `FTTH` (Fiber-to-the-home) 200/200 Mbps
* Interactive-TV from KPN
* I **do not**  use telephony from KPN
* Experia box V10A from KPN
* FortiGate 60F (FortiOS 6.4)
* Internal switch where I can do some vlan-stuff with

**You MUST use FortiOS 6.4 for this to work. Otherwise, the DHCP-client option which is used for iTV cannot be configured as this option is only available in FortiOS 6.4**


# What did I want to realize? #

I **do not** want to use the Experia box of KPN! I want to use my own FortiGate firewall to take over all the functions of the Experia box (apart from WiFi, where I have my own access-points)

# What are the topics? #

The topics to build are:
* Internet-connectivity (IPv4 & IPv6)
* iTV including replay and recordings

# Building Internet
My ISP-connection is delivered over fiber, which is delivered with an UTP-connection from the NTU. The UTP cable is going directly into the WAN-port of my FortiGate.

Good to know is that KPN is providing me 3 vlans in total to carry their services:
* vlan 4 = iTV
* vlan 5 = Telephony
* vlan 6 = Internet

So, first I need to create a vlan-interface for vlan 6 on the WAN-port. Because of the PPPoE overhead, the MTU of the WAN-port needs to be set to **1514** bytes, and the vlan-interface itself needs to be set to **1506** bytes.
{% highlight ruby %}
config system interface
    edit "wan1"
        set mtu-override enable
        set mtu 1514
    next

    edit "internet"
        set alias "vlan6"
        set estimated-upstream-bandwidth 200000
        set estimated-downstream-bandwidth 200000
        set role wan
        set snmp-index 8
        set mtu-override enable
        set mtu 1506
        set interface "wan1"
        set vlanid 6
    next
end
{% endhighlight %}
Next, we want to create the PPPoE-Interface. We bind this PPPoE-interface to the wan1 interface.
{% highlight ruby %}
config system interface
    edit "pppoe1"
        set mode pppoe
        set allowaccess ping
        set type tunnel
        set estimated-upstream-bandwidth 200000
        set estimated-downstream-bandwidth 200000
        config ipv6
            set ip6-mode dhcp
            set ip6-allowaccess ping
            set dhcp6-prefix-delegation enable
        end
        set interface "internet"
    next
end
{% endhighlight %}
Note the `config ipv6` IPv6 part; this part is neccesary to get an IPv6-prefix, which is advertised by the ISP via DHCPv6 prefix-delegation or **DHCPv6-PD**.

When we take a look of the PPPoE interface-part in the GUI of the FortiGate, you should see the IPv4 address which we have got from KPN.

 we can also see that there is nothing visible about the DHCPv6-PD config. So, this part is only visible (and configurable) under the CLI.

If everything is okay, it should be possible to send some pings to hosts on the Internet over IPv4.
{% highlight ruby %}
FGT60F # execute ping www.google.com
PING www.google.com (172.217.19.196): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 172.217.19.196: icmp_seq=0 ttl=119 time=3.4 ms
64 bytes from 172.217.19.196: icmp_seq=1 ttl=119 time=3.4 ms

--- www.google.com ping statistics ---
5 packets transmitted, 5 packets received, 0% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max = 3.4/3.4/3.4 ms
{% endhighlight %}
If your ping is working, then you have succesfully configured an IPv4 Internet-connection with your FortiGate. Now you can start with building your IPv4 policy-rules for your internal vlan (which is not part of this post).

At this moment, it is not possible (yet) to ping an IPv6 host on the Internet:
{% highlight ruby %}
FGT60F # execute ping6 ipv6.google.com
connect: Network is unreachable
{% endhighlight %}
The ping6 is not working because there is no route for IPv6 defined. We need to do this statically. We point the IPv6 default-route to the pppoe1 interface.
{% highlight ruby %}
config router static6
    edit 1
        set device "pppoe1"
    next
end
{% endhighlight %}
After this, you should be able to ping an IPv6 host:
{% highlight ruby %}
FGT60F # exec ping6 ipv6.google.com
PING ipv6.google.com(2a00:1450:400e:806::200e) 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 2a00:1450:400e:806::200e: icmp_seq=1 ttl=120 time=3.71 ms
64 bytes from 2a00:1450:400e:806::200e: icmp_seq=2 ttl=120 time=3.73 ms
64 bytes from 2a00:1450:400e:806::200e: icmp_seq=3 ttl=120 time=3.66 ms
64 bytes from 2a00:1450:400e:806::200e: icmp_seq=4 ttl=120 time=3.66 ms
64 bytes from 2a00:1450:400e:806::200e: icmp_seq=5 ttl=120 time=3.68 ms
{% endhighlight %}
Now IPv6 is working to the outside world, we need to route it internally so that hosts can get an IPv6 address (Global Unicast). Therefore, we need to configure an IPv6-prefix on the inside interface of the FortiGate.

As KPN is giving you a `/48` prefix, we can assign an `/64` prefix to the internal network. The hosts which are internally, are getting an IPv6 address using SLAAC, which is the most easiest way to address your hosts for IPv6. Another option is to configure DHCPv6 (not part of this post).

Note that the `2a02:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx::/64` part of the config should be your IPv6 range which is allocated to you by KPN. If you don't know this prefix, you can find this when you connect your Experia box and take a look in the web-interface.
{% highlight ruby %}
config system interface
    edit "internal"
        set ip 10.1.1.1 255.255.255.0
        set allowaccess ping https ssh http fgfm
        set role lan
        config ipv6
            set ip6-mode delegated
            set ip6-allowaccess ping
            set ip6-send-adv enable
            set ip6-upstream-interface "pppoe1"
            set ip6-subnet 2a02:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx::/64
            config ip6-delegated-prefix-list
                edit 1
                    set upstream-interface "pppoe1"
                    set subnet 2a02:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx::/64
                next
            end
        end
    next
end
{% endhighlight %}
When this config is done, you should be able to check if the IPv6-prefix is allocated to the internal interface.
{% highlight ruby %}
FGT60F # diagnose ipv6 address list
#--- output ommitted ---
dev=25 devname=internal flag= scope=0 prefix=64 addr=2a02:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:: preferred=171972 valid=258372 cstamp=10939 tstamp=10939

#--- output ommitted ---
{% endhighlight %}
Note: I've seen that I need to restart the firewall to get this step done.

The final thing to do to get IPv6 working for your hosts, is to create a policy-rule for v6 in the FortiGate **without NAT**. Since NAT is not usual with IPv6, we do not enable this.
{% highlight ruby %}
config firewall policy
    edit 0
        set name "outbound-internet v6"
        set srcintf "internal"
        set dstintf "pppoe1"
        set srcaddr6 "all"
        set dstaddr6 "all"
        set action accept
        set schedule "always"
        set service "ALL"
        set utm-status enable
	next
end
{% endhighlight %}
Now, as we take an internal host (I have a Win10 PC) then you can try to do an `ipconfig /all` to see your IPv6 addresses (you will get 2 temporary adresses).
