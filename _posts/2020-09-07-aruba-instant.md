Here are some common en pratical commands which I often use in the field when I work with Aruba Instant wireless AP's.

{% highlight ruby %}
show clients #show active clients and their role
show aps #show active access-points
disconnect-user #the ability to disconnect users
{% endhighlight %}


## For troubleshooting

{% highlight ruby %}
show log system
{% endhighlight %}
